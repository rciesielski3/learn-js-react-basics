## 🧠 What’s Inside

### 🔹 JavaScript Concepts

| Topic                 | Location         | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `this` keyword        | `/js/this`       | Compare global, strict, object, arrow, bound, and class contexts of `this`       |
| Classes & Inheritance | `/js/classes`    | Explore ES6 classes, inheritance, prototypes, static methods, and private fields |
| Algorithms            | `/js/algorithms` | Run common and advanced JS algorithm examples interactively                      |

### 🔸 React Fundamentals

| Topic            | Location             | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lifecycle        | `/react/lifecycle`   | Observe React mount/update/unmount behaviors and logs                                         |
| Virtual DOM      | `/react/virtual-dom` | See how updates re-render efficiently                                                         |
| Hooks Playground | `/react/hooks`       | Test and compare key hooks like `useState`, `useMemo`, `useReducer`, and more                 |
| Hook Comparisons | `/react/comparision` | Understand nuanced differences between similar hooks (`useEffect` vs `useLayoutEffect`, etc.) |
